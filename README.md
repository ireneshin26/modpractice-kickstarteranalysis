It is also shown that the crowdfunding projects under the Parent Category of Theater had the most participation as well as the most successful and failed campaigns out of all the categories. In addition, looking at the distribution of goal and total pledged amounts for musical projects in Great Britain, we can see that the average campaign goal is around £4,000 so Louise is recommended to produce her play under £4,000.
